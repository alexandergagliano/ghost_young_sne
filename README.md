# Host Matching for Young SNe
A quick wrapper to find the host galaxies of young SN candidates using the astro_ghost package.

## Steps for installing ghost:
1. Create a clean conda environment (optional, but makes sure packages don't conflict)

2. Run the following code:
```bash
pip install astro_ghost
```
## Run the code youngSNe_ghost.py at the command line, passing in the path to the csv file (that you got from the SQL Explorer Script).
